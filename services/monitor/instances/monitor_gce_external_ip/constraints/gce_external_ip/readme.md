# gce_external_ip

## Background

Avoid public IP addresses on Compute engine instances (VMs) significantly reduces the attack surface.

External IPs for GCE VMs are forbidden.

Instances without a IP addresses can be accessed from the internal network (VPN, Interconnect) or using IAP tunnels, or behing load balancers.

## Fix

```shell
gcloud compute instances delete-access-config INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE -- access-config-name "ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME"
```
