## Background

Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) lets you manage access to applications running in App Engine standard environment, App Engine flexible environment. IAP establishes a central authorization layer for applications accessed by HTTPS, so you can **adopt an application-level access control model instead of using network-level firewalls.**

When you turn on IAP, you must also use signed headers or the App Engine standard environment Users API to secure your app.
