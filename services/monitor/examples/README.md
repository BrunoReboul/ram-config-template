# Rules examples to be adapted

For each example:

- Review the code and readme.md
- Adapt the constraint YAML file to your environment:
  - E.g. What are the location where you agree to store data in the cloud ? Asia, EU, UA ?
  - E.g. What is the scope this rule should apply to ? org / folder ... folder / project ?
- Move the rule folder to the `services/monitor/instances` folder
- Test the rule and validate

Delete the `examples` folder when empty
